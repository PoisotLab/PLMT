# Poisot Lab Manuscript Template

This template is a way to make writing academic papers using `pandoc` and
`markdown` simple.

To compile, use `make`. If you have a `Rmd` or a `md` file (`Jmd` can be
activated in the `Makefile`) in your directory (and it is called `manuscript`),
then things should worlk.

## Is it standard markdown?

Yes.

## What do you need?

- `pandoc`
- `LaTeX`
- `node` and `npm`
- GNU `make`
- an idea for a manuscript
- `knitr`, `Weave.jl` if you need to render these sort of things

## Roadmap

- URL should be visible somehow
- PDF metadata
